You Own the NFT. Each Virtual Ravers is an NFT on the Arbitrum blockchain. When you purchase an NFT, you own the underlying Virtual Ravers, the Art, completely. Ownership of the NFT is mediated entirely by the Smart Contract and the Arbitrum Network: at no point may we seize, freeze, or otherwise modify the ownership of any Virtual Ravers.</p><p class="terms-description">B. Personal Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Optimized Intelligence Industries grants you a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art, along with any extensions that you choose to create or use, solely for the following purposes: (i) for your own personal, non-commercial use; (ii) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Virtual Ravers / NFT, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Virtual Ravers owner‚Äôs rights to display the Art for their Virtual Ravers to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; or (iii) as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of your Virtual Ravers, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies each Virtual Ravers owner‚Äôs rights to display the Art for their Virtual Ravers to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Virtual Ravers leaves the website/application.</p><p class="terms-description">C. Commercial Use. Subject to your continued compliance with these Terms, Optimized Intelligence Industries grants you an unlimited, worldwide license to use, copy, and display the purchased Art for the purpose of creating derivative works based upon the Art (‚ÄúCommercial Use‚Äù). Examples of such Commercial Use would e.g. be the use of the Art to produce and sell merchandise products (T-Shirts etc.) displaying copies of the Art. For the sake of clarity, nothing in this Section will be deemed to restrict you from (i) owning or operating a marketplace that permits the use and sale of Virtual Ravers generally, provided that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Virtual Ravers owner‚Äôs rights to display the Art for their Virtual Ravers to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art; (ii) owning or operating a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or participation of Virtual Ravers generally, provided that the third party website or application cryptographically verifies each Virtual Ravers owner‚Äôs rights to display the Art for their Virtual Ravers to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Art, and provided that the Art is no longer visible once the owner of the Purchased Virtual Ravers leaves the website/application; or (iii) earning revenue from any of the foregoing.</p><p class="terms-description">D. OII IP.&nbsp; Other than the rights to the Art, nothing herein gives you any rights to any other trademarks or other intellectual property rights belonging to Optimized Intelligence Industries including, without limitation, to Virtual Ravers and the associated logos. All of these rights are expressly reserved in the name of Optimized Intelligence Industries.</p><p class="terms-description">E. Feedback.
